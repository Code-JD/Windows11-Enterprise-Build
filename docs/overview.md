# Project Overview

This HomeLab project rebuilds and hardens a Windows 11 workstation to simulate how an organization would secure and manage employee endpoints.

The goals of the project are to:

- Learn and apply enterprise-grade security controls
- Write automation using PowerShell
- Implement repeatable system configuration
- Use Git and documentation workflows used by real IT teams
- Produce logs suitable for SOC-style investigations
- Build portfolio-ready material for IT/cybersecurity roles

The system remains fully functional for gaming and development while following industry security practices.
